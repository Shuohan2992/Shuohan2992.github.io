I am a Master of Science student in the Systems Engineering program at Cornell University.  
My research focuses on photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting. Prior to my graduate studies,  
I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics, where I developed a strong foundation in  
quantitative analysis, statistics, and optimization. I am especially passionate about applying  
data-driven approaches to real-world energy problems.

Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking and skiingâ€”activities that help me recharge and appreciate  
the beauty of nature. Whether climbing up trails or cruising down slopes, I always find inspiration outdoors.
