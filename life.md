## âœ¨ Exploring Life Beyond Code

Outside of academics, I love traveling and photography. Capturing moments around the world through my lens helps me see the beauty in everyday life. Here are some of my favorite shots:

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px;">

  <img src="/assets/images/photo2.jpg" alt="Photo 2" style="width: 30%;">
  <img src="/assets/images/photo3.jpg" alt="Photo 3" style="width: 30%;">
</div>
